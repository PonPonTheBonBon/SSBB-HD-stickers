Mission to finding high quality images to replace the original images from the game

### Progress
25 / 700 stickers in HD  
`██____________________________________________________________________` (2 %)

### Who can help?
Anyone is free to fork and then make a pull request.  
Make sure you follow [my process of making the stickers](/process.diff).  
If you disagree with the process, feel free to open an issue.

Reference [the progress document](progress.diff) which will tell you  
which are still missing (red) and which are now in HD (green).

Also reference [complete list of stickers](https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_stickers_(complete_list)) for names and images,  
but you can also find images in this repo as well, in folder [stickers original](/stickers%20original).

### Can I use these?
Feel free to download the folder "stickers HD" and put it in the game.  
Follow guides regarding replacing internal files with external ones.
