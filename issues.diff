Issues regarding finding the original artworks

- tex1_80x130_86044840e67f91c5_ebcf5ed688032016_9 : Rover (Animal Crossing: WW)
The image used in Brawl doesn't seem to be publicly available. A 4x waifu2x upscaled image is used instead.

- tex1_100x87_fe3bc9c9ecbdd350_9531c86338620872_9 : Propeller Shy Guy (Yoshi's Story)
The image used in Brawl doesn't seem to be publicly available.
It is close to the sprite used in Melee, but it isn't exact, neither is it the desing from Yoshi's Story.
The image appears to be higher quality than either of those two, and might be a secret internal image.
