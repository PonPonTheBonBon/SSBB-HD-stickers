+ tex1_141x160_68abef785a803a25_4c5f8a309625604a_9 : Peach (Super Mario Bros. 2)
In Brawl, the image appears to have been redrawn; the lineart doesn't match up with the source scan.

+ tex1_122x130_e3fa36912168136a_02d243e2c7f904c0_9 : Water Fairy Elias (Nintendo Puzzle Collection)
In Brawl, the image appears to have been redrawn; the only publicly available image is the cropped sprite.
It is possible that Brawl uses an internal concept art. Current HD sticker uses the sprite + 4x waifu2x upscaled original sticker.

+ tex1_135x160_c0b63c10a387d2c3_88cde97c9221c205_9 : Samus (Metroid)
In Brawl, the image appears to have been cut out from the Famicom Disc System cover, from an unknown high quality source.
Some parts appear to not have been properly cut out, such as the thumb, which is not reflected in the HD sticker.
