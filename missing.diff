- tex1_100x87_fe3bc9c9ecbdd350_9531c86338620872_9 : Propeller Shy Guy (Yoshi's Story)
The image used in Brawl doesn't seem to be publicly available.
It is close to the sprite used in Melee, but it isn't exact, neither is it the desing from Yoshi's Story.
The image appears to be higher quality than either of those two, and might be a secret internal image.

- tex1_47x100_faa84029b53e182c_ab6769489c0bf950_9 : Akari Hayami (Wave Race: BS)
The image used in Brawl doesn't seem to be publicly available.
A large but cropped version of the image can be found in various thumbnails,
but not the full character artwork.
